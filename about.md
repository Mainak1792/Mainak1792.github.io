Hi, my name is Mainak Chakraborty, and I’m a 1st-year PhD student  at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. I work in the [Centre for Sensors, Instrumentation and cyber-physical system engineering](https://sense.iitd.ac.in/content/about-us).


Previously, I have worked at the Robotics and Automation department of [CSIR-Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute](https://www.cmeri.res.in/department/robotics-and-automation), as a research trainee under [Dr. Srinivasan Aruchamy](https://www.cmeri.res.in/user-details/1360). My research topic has been in "Human Activity Classification using Machine learning and seismic sensor". contact me for furthur details.

I graduated with a Master’s in mechatronics from IIEST-Shibpur in 2021, and have interned at RemoCardia(2021) [Remocardia](https://remo.care/) in the past, where I worked on multiple arrythmia classification using bi-LSTM. My research in IIEST, Shibpur was supported by GATE Fellowship(2019-2021) under [Dr. Subhasis Bhaumik](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/Faculty/aero-subhasis). I have also worked for [Wobot.ai](https://wobot.ai/) as a Data Engineer(2021), for couple months.

I currently Volunteer at [ProxMaq](https://proxmaq.com/), a Deep learning startup where we are developing a wearable device(glasses) for blind people. 

You can find also me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mainak001/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/mainak_1996). Feel free to contact me with any suggestions/advice.
