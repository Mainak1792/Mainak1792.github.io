Hi, my name is Mainak Chakraborty, and I’m a 1st-year PhD student  at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. I work in the ![Centre for Sensors, Instrumentation and cyber-physical system engineering](https://sense.iitd.ac.in/content/about-us).


Previously, I have worked in ![CSIR-CMERI](https://www.cmeri.res.in/department/robotics-and-automation), as a research trainee under Dr. Srinivasan Aruchamy. My research topic has been in "Human Activity Classification using Machine learning and seismic sensor". 

I graduated with a Master’s in mechatronics from IIEST-Shibpur in 2021, and have interned at RemoCardia(2021) ![Remocardia](https://remo.care/) in the past. My research in IIEST, Shibpur was supported by GATE Fellowship(2019-2021).

I also Volunteer at ![https://proxmaq.com/](ProxMaq), a Deep learning startup where we are developing a wearable device(glasses) for blind people. 

You can find me on GitHub. Feel free to take a look at my resume or contact me.
