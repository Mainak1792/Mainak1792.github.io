I am a PhD researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, focusing on advanced sensor‑based machine learning and seismic data analysis. My work combines deep learning, embedded systems, and signal processing to tackle problems in predictive maintenance, remote health diagnostics, and wildlife conservation. Awarded fellowships such as the GATE- 2019, Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship (PMRF)-2022, and IEEE SPS Fellowship-2024. I have led interdisciplinary teams to build vibration sensor–based early warning systems and deploy AI models on edge devices. My research contributions have been published in venues like ICASSP, ACM-SENSYS, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, and IEEE Sensor Letters. My technical repertoire spans Python, C/C++, embedded systems, TensorFlow, and PyTorch—skill sets that have enabled me to deploy real‑time deep learning solutions for industrial and social‑impact applications. Through my research, teaching, and collaborative projects, I aim to bridge cutting‑edge AI methodologies with real‑world problems, fostering innovation and societal betterment. This is my home on the internet 🚀.

My research is focused on Human Cognition, Locomotion and Identification using non-intrusive ambient sensors.
