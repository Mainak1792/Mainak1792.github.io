<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a PhD researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, focusing on advanced sensorâ€‘based machine learning and seismic data analysis. My work combines deep learning, embedded systems, and signal processing to tackle problems in predictive maintenance, remote health diagnostics, and wildlife conservation. Awarded fellowships such as the GATEâ€‘2019, Prime Ministerâ€™s Research Fellowship (PMRF)â€‘2022, and IEEE SPS Fellowshipâ€‘2024, I have led interdisciplinary teams to build vibration sensorâ€“based early warning systems and deploy AI models on edge devices. 

My research contributions have been published in venues like ICASSP, ACMâ€‘SENSYS, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, and IEEE Sensor Letters. My technical repertoire spans Python, C/C++, embedded systems, TensorFlow, and PyTorchâ€”skill sets that have enabled me to deploy realâ€‘time deep learning solutions for industrial and socialâ€‘impact applications. Through my research, teaching, and collaborative projects, I aim to bridge cuttingâ€‘edge AI methodologies with realâ€‘world problems, fostering innovation and societal betterment. This is my home on the internet ðŸš€.

My research is focused on Human Cognition, Locomotion, and Identification using non-intrusive ambient sensors.
