I am currently advised by Prof. Subrat Kar. My Research at IIT-Delhi is supported by Prime Minister Research Fellowship (PMRF). I graduated from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology(IIEST), Shibpur with an M.Tech in Mechatronics in 2021. At IIEST, my research was supported by the GATE scholarship. After that, I joined the Robotics and Automation Department of CSIR-CMERI as a research Assistant from 2020 to 2021. This is my home on the internet ðŸš€.

My research is focused on Human Cognition, Locomotion and Identification using non-intrusive ambient sensors.
